# Customer churn prediction with Machine Learning
## Overview
This project implements a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a telecom customer will churn (i.e., switch to another provider or discontinue the service).
Three different approaches to preprocessing the dataset were used to demonstrate various ways of handling the data.

## Data
Dataset was downloaded from Kaggle datasets, consisting in a CSV file with 10 (9 + target) columns and 1000 rows.

## Results
The model achieved a training accuracy of 100% and over 99% accuracy on the test data. However, the dataset is too small to draw any definitive conclusions.
